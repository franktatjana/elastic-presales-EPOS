# EPOS Elastic Process of (pre-) sales

**Summary**

- **A guided path** for pre-sales engagement with defined stages (discovery, demo, technical Q&A) and tools (ESAT, Vivun, Zapier, Google Suite) allows streamlining prerequisites, CTAs, and deliverables
- **Top-down approach**: company profile and info about products/services leads to a specific process to improve embedded into the business context and to specific data/requirements we focus on
- **Bottom-up approach**: specific technical needs mapped to a certain process/service which lead to the importance of the project in the context of the companies business
- **Mapping business challenges to technical needs** for **observability** exemplify how unknown cause for downtime impacts customer satisfaction
- **Mapping business challenges to technical needs** for **security** exemplify how limited visibility and blind spots in

## Project Background 

The pre-sales engagement process is critical for businesses looking to close deals and drive revenue. However, gapful communication, missing information about the business of the customers, lack of understanding of which information is relevant, and transfer of information may result in delays, mistakes, and lost opportunities, which can impact the bottom line.

## Proposed Solution

Identify and describe a process for pre-sales engagement, define tool sets for each phase, centralize reusable information like building blocks, and automate subtasks in the sales process in order to improve **consistency**, **efficiency,** and **effectiveness** in achieving desired **outcomes**.

A process in place has a clear description of phases and tools, and lists of projects in the hands of SAs, e.g. a Monday board: preparation, discovery, D2W, POC, tech Q&A (features/ architecture), and sizing assigned to a relevant phase. Initially focus on **observability** at the early stage.

* _Consistency is known set of steps to measure and improve performance_

* _Efficiency: clear guidance on what steps to take and when to take them to reduce the amount of time and effort required to close deals, as well as to minimize errors and mistakes_

* _Effectiveness: focused on the right activities and using the right techniques at the right stage_


**Additional requirements**:

- define specific metrics for measuring the success of the new process, such as MTTC (mean time to close)
- conduct a pilot test with a small sample size before rolling it out to the sales team
- provide training for sales reps and managers to ensure effective utilization
- create a centralized repository for the reuse of created content
