# How to help Sales Team to be compfortable with technical topics

## Introduction
>//TODO explain
- communication/enabelement goal is not to remember, but to connect
- know your target group (what is importnat for sales team, why, how they retrieve information, how we can simplify and operationalize it)
- sales are not IT for a reason, otherwise they would be IT folks: identify goals, fears, needs
- approach "how to fish" 

## General Framework 4 Iterations
1. iteration SAs show a favorite feature/capability; Sales bring 5 questions about feature/capability
2. iteration Sales and SA bring a favorite story from customer slides
3. iteration SAs inform about dark side of the capability, pitfalls to avoid; Sales 3 questions
4. iteration SAs informa why we are better; Sales bring 3 questions

**Result individual pitch deck/ lookup resource for sales reps**

## General Framework 2 Iterations 
1. iteration SAs show a favorite feature/capability/story; Sales bring 5 questions about feature/capability
2. iteration Do's and Dont's for the capability/feature

### 1 iteration
- SA show favorite logging feature and explain why, e.g spikes in logs, highlighting

# How to map Business challenges to technical requirements/expectations 

## Observability
* Business challenge: Lost revenue or reduced productivity due to high system downtime
* Technical requirement: High system downtime, real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities
* Relevant data: system and application logs, metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and application performance
* Tools: **Log aggregators**, tracing tools, monitoring dashboards

## Security
* Business Challenge: The company has experienced several cyber attacks in the past, leading to data breaches and loss of customer trust.
* Technical Requirement: Implement a robust intrusion detection system to identify and respond to threats.
* Relevant Data: Network logs, system logs, security alerts.
* Tools: SIEM to **analyze logs in real-time**, detect suspicious activity, and generate alert, incident response capabilities to investigate and contain security incidents.
