# The (Missing) Link between Business Challenges and Technical Requirements

## Problem Definition
> //TODO: explain

Missing a clear understanding of customer business and its processes leads to the following problems:

**Difficulty in demonstrating the value of the software** 

If you do not understand your customer's business processes, you may struggle to demonstrate how your solution can provide value and solve their specific challenges, leading to lower sales.

**Reduced customer satisfaction** 

If your solution does not align with the customer's business processes and does not solve their specific problems, it may lead to reduced customer satisfaction and negative reviews, damaging your reputation and future sales.

**Limited upselling opportunities** 

If you lack a clear understanding of the customer's business and processes, you may miss opportunities to upsell and offer additional services or solutions that would benefit their operations, resulting in missed revenue opportunities.

## Solutions

**The Top-Down analysis** involves starting with an overview of the business and its objectives and then drilling down to identify specific needs and requirements.


T**he Bottom-Up analysis** begins with the technical requirements and then works upward to identify the business needs that those requirements address.
